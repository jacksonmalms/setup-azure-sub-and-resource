First, you are obviously going to need to create an account. Go to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ and click the green start free button. (Unfortunately you will need a credit card to create your free account, there really isn't any way around this, it just is what it is)

After your account setup and confirmation is complete (which may take a minute), you will get redircted to this page. From here, click the blue "Go to the Azure portal" button or you can go to https://portal.azure.com (<-- this is a good link to memorize) and it will sign you into the portal with whichever account that you are currently signed into.
